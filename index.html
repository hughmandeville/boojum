      <p>
        I love a story, and I especially love sharing that story vocally. The tradition of oral storytelling is something that resonates with all peoples and cultures across all of history, it is an essential part of each and every one of us. It brings us all together. If your story needs a voice to help share it, please feel free to contact me. I would love to connect with you.
